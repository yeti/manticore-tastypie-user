=======================

User relevant API resources for getting signing up, logging in, getting user information, and editing user information.

Currently requires a UserProfile module to be set in AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE under settings.py. Will update to the new
Django 1.5 custom auth model when Mezzanine upgrades.
